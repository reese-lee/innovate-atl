# InnovateATL Hackathon + Observability Workshops

Welcome to the InnovateATL Hackathon! This event aims to bring together talented engineers, public sector experts, and the local tech community to develop innovative solutions for Atlanta's most pressing public sector challenges. 

We are also hosting a few observability workshops to supplement your projects -- check them out below!  

## Objectives

- **Harness Cutting-Edge AI:** Utilize state-of-the-art LLMs to build creative solutions addressing Atlanta's pressing issues.
- **Public Sector Collaboration:** Foster collaboration between engineers and public sector experts for impactful, practical solutions.
- **Community Engagement:** Engage the local tech community to support public welfare through technology.
- **Solution Implementation:** Develop practical prototypes that can be piloted and implemented by the city's departments.

## Problem Statements

Participants can choose from one of the following key challenges or propose their own issue related to the public sector in Atlanta:

### Improving Public Transportation
**Problem:** Enhance communication and service accessibility for MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority).
- **Solution Examples:** AI-powered chatbots for real-time customer support, natural language-based trip planning, and feedback systems.

### Enhancing Emergency Services Communication
**Problem:** Optimize communication between emergency responders and the public.
- **Solution Examples:** LLM-driven public alerts system, predictive emergency response models using public data, and advanced disaster communication platforms.

### Streamlining City Administration
**Problem:** Improve citizen engagement and streamline administrative processes.
- **Solution Examples:** Automated FAQs and chatbot assistants for city departments, paperwork simplification using NLP, and real-time feedback mechanisms.

### Facilitating Homeless Support Services
**Problem:** Coordinate support services for the homeless population.
- **Solution Examples:** NLP-enabled data collection for service needs, automated resource directories, and LLM-assisted case management.

### Promoting Transparency in Local Governance
**Problem:** Enhance transparency and citizen participation in local government decisions.
- **Solution Examples:** NLP-based analysis of public documents, citizen-friendly government portals, and automated policy brief generation.

## Example Project

### 311+
Users can take a photo of a car break-in incident, and the tool automatically inputs a 311 report, using metadata from the photo to identify the location and time. "311+" fills out the necessary form, making it easier for victims to report incidents quickly and accurately.

## Guidelines

- **Team Size:** 3-5 members per team

### Technology

- **Preferred LLMs:** GPT-4, GPT-3, LLaMA, Claude, etc.
- **Other Technologies:** NLP frameworks, machine learning libraries, and relevant public datasets

### Submission Requirements

- **Source Code Repository**
- **Technical Documentation**
- **Solution Presentation (10-minute pitch)**
- **Demo Video (max. 3 minutes)**

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Relevance (20%):** How well does the solution address the identified public sector challenge?
- **Innovation (20%):** Is the solution novel and creative in its approach?
- **Technical Implementation (20%):** Quality of code, design, and technical documentation.
- **Scalability (20%):** Potential for implementation across multiple departments/organizations.
- **User Experience (20%):** How intuitive and user-friendly is the solution?

## Prizes

- **First Place:** $7,000
- **Second Place:** $3,000
- **Third Place:** $1,000

We are excited to see your innovative solutions and how they can help transform Atlanta's public sector! Happy hacking!

## Observability Workshops

### **Exploring Observability and Software Debugging, with Rita Hill**: June 13, 1:15-3:15PM
In this beginner level workshop, participants will gain an understanding of how observability helps software engineering teams to understand the health and performance of their systems—and see beyond not just what errors occur, but to know when and why. Through interactive discussions and hands-on exercises, participants will explore the core pillars of observability and will learn how these practices enable engineers to gain insights into the inner workings of their applications, diagnose issues effectively, and make informed decisions to enhance performance and reliability. By the end of the workshop, participants will walk away with a foundation in observability principles and practical techniques to apply within their own projects.

### **Spill the Tea on Frontend Errors with Session Replay, with Spence Taylor**: June 13, 4:00-6:00PM
Have you ever had an error you couldn't easily diagnose? Maybe you struggled to understand the cause of an uncaught exception? Maybe a customer filed a ticket and you couldn't reproduce the set of user actions that lead to their issue. In this session, you will learn how to use monitoring and observability tools to easily identify and diagnose errors, and get visibility into user actions that lead to an error or crash.

### What's Wrong with my App?: Using OpenTelemetry to Observe Your Code, with Reese Lee: June 14, 10:00AM-12:00PM
Having observability into your applications and infrastructure empowers you with multiple benefits, including being able to pinpoint issues in your code down to the line, minimize application downtime, and ensure your system is running smoothly. Being able to pinpoint issues in your code down to the line, minimize application downtime, and ensure your system is running smoothly – these, and many more benefits, are only possible when you have observability into your applications and infrastructure.

OpenTelemetry is both a framework and a tool for implementing observability, and New Relic is a data visualization and storage platform – by leveraging both, you can achieve observability. In this beginner-level workshop, you’ll use a multi-language demo application to learn about OpenTelemetry instrumentation, basic Collector architecture, and how to debug common issues, such as missing data, as well as how to navigate your traces, metrics, and logs in New Relic.
